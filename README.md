# AWS Lambda Functions

Simple AWS Lambda Functions written in Go to facilitate my exploration of building applications in AWS


## Notes
1. This repo uses Github Action to build & push compiled Golang into S3 and from there Functions are deployed with Terraform
2. Lambda function gets build by Golang version 1.20
